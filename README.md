# Shoe Store

ShoeStore is the first project of the Android Kotlin Developer nanodegree provided by Udacity. It is a test project for the first chapter of the course, _Developing Android Apps with Kotlin_.
The project focuses on building and managing the application layout, and demonstrates the ability to exploit the following components from the Jetpack library:
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/)
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/), with the SafeArgs plugin for parameter passing between fragments

The project consists of initial screens - login and general information - for introducing the user to the application, and then of two screens for implementing a shoe store, one displaying all the shoes saved in a list and another one to add or modify a shoe entry.

Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/PaoloCaldera/shoeStore/wiki) to see the application screens.
